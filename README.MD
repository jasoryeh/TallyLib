# Tally
Originally used in VectorMC for statistics tracking on Atlas, this project is now expanded for general statistics tracking.

## Core vs Snap In
- Core = the basic stats needed to track in the server software this core plugin is built for
- [Snap In](https://github.com/jasoryeh/TallySnapins) = extensions that hook into core to support custom software

## Functionality
As you might notice, this library/api interacts with another api. I went this route to reduce the types of storage needed to be implemented and to just settle on one statistics platform.

## Where is the server?
Server is your website that accepts API requests!
